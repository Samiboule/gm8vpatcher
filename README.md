# Special thanks
Quentin Januel for making [I wanna play online](https://gitlab.com/i-wanna-play-online/modder) which this tool is based on

Renex and Floogle for finding out about this weird vsync issue and making [a gamemaker extension](https://github.com/omicronrex/gm82vpatch) to fix this
As far as I'm aware this issue only really happens in gm8
